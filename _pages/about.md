I'm currently a Phd candidate at [https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/research-students/rein-liu-210.html]University of Sydney in Electrical and Information Engineering. I'm currently exploring neural audio synthesis for sound design applications. Specifically, my research focus is utilizing audio generative models and differentiable digital signal processing methods to create, synthesize, and control sound effects generation. 

Prior to my Phd, I received my B.A. Music and Sound Design at University of Technology Sydney and M.A. Interaction Design and Electronic Arts at University of Sydney. 

Outside from work, I'm also a performer and teacher in a unique instrument called Theremin. You can find my performances here.
